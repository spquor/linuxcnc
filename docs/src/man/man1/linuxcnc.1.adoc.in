== NAME

linuxcnc - LinuxCNC (The Enhanced Machine Controller)

== SYNOPSIS

*linuxcnc* [_-h_] [_-v_] [_-d_] [_-r_] [_-l_] [_-k_] [_-t <tpmodulename>
 [parameters]_] [_-m <homemodulename> [parameters]_] [_-H <dirname>_]
 [_INI file_]

== DESCRIPTION

*linuxcnc* is used to start LinuxCNC (The Enhanced Machine Controller).
It starts the realtime system and then initializes a number of LinuxCNC
components (IO, Motion, GUI, HAL, etc). The most important parameter is
_INI file_, which specifies the configuration name you would like to
run. If _INI file_ is not specified, the *linuxcnc* script presents a
graphical wizard to let you choose one.

== OPTIONS

*-h*::
  Shows the help
*-v*::
  Be a little bit verbose. This causes the script to print information
  as it works.
*-d*::
  Print lots of debug information. All executed commands are echoed to
  the screen. This mode is useful when something is not working as it
  should.
*-r*::
  Disable redirection of stdout and stderr to `~/linuxcnc_print.txt` and
  `~/linuxcnc_debug.txt` when stdin is not a tty. Used when running
  linuxcnc tests non-interactively.
*-l*::
  Use the last-used INI file without prompting. This is often a good
  choice for a shortcut command or startup item.
*-k*::
  Continue in the presence of errors in HAL files
*-t <tpmodulename> [parameters]*::
  Specify custom trajectory_planning_module overrides optional INI
  setting [TRAJ]TPMOD
*-m <homemodulename> [parameters]*::
  Specify custom homing_module overrides optional INI setting
  [EMCMOT]HOMEMOD
*-H <dirname>*::
  Search dirname for HAL files before searching INI directory and system
  library: $HALLIB_DIR
*<INIFILE>*::
  The INI file is the main piece of a LinuxCNC configuration. It is not
  the entire configuration; there are various other files that go with
  it (NML files, HAL files, TBL files, VAR files). It is, however, the
  most important one, because it is the file that holds the
  configuration together. It can adjust a lot of parameters itself, but
  it also tells *linuxcnc* which other files to load and use.

There are several ways to specify which config to use:

Specify the absolute path to an INI, e.g., +
*linuxcnc* _/usr/local/linuxcnc/configs/sim/sim.ini_

Specify a relative path from the current directory, e.g. +
*linuxcnc* _configs/sim/sim.ini_

Otherwise, in the case where the *INIFILE* is not specified, the
behavior will depend on whether you configured LinuxCNC with
*--enable-run-in-place*. If so, the LinuxCNC config chooser will search
only the configs directory in your source tree. If not (or if you are
using a packaged version of LinuxCNC), it may search several
directories. The config chooser is currently set to search the path:

....
@LINUXCNC_CONFIG_PATH@
....

== EXAMPLES

*linuxcnc*

*linuxcnc* _configs/sim/sim.ini_

*linuxcnc* _/etc/linuxcnc/sample-configs/stepper/stepper_mm.ini_
